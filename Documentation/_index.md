We have a common [Typescript Build Pipeline](https://www.github.com/dolittle-tools/TypeScript.Build) that bundles all the tools that we use for setting up our TypeScripts projects.

Essentially all this package does is provide the dependencies you'd need for a typescript project using Mocha + Sinon + Chai for testing 
as well as a pre-configured configuration for [Wallaby](https://wallabyjs.com/) and for running tests with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
