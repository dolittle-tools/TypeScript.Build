We have a common [Typescript Build Pipeline](https://www.github.com/dolittle-tools/TypeScript.Build) that bundles all the tools that we use for setting up our TypeScripts projects.

Essentially all this package does is provide the building blocks you'd need for a typescript project using Mocha + Sinon + Chai for testing.

This package is just a building block in order for us to provide pre-configured build packages for building TypeScript libraries using gulp and node, and client applications using webpack.
